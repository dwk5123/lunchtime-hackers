/*/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
A store manager is bulk ordering cups and lids from different companies based 
on what sales are going on. (And all word problems for programming competitions
have bizarre scenarios)

The cup manufacturer being used for this order only sells cups in packs of
52, and the lid manufacturer for this purchase only sells lids in packs of
102. What are the three smallest order of cups the manager will have to
purchase if she doesn't want to have any extra lids or cups?

Make sure that your program can be re-used every time she runs out of cups
because she often switches companies, which means different sized packages.

Hint: the program should work if she expands her business (read: requires
larger amounts of cups)

--Sample Case 1--
INPUT:
52
102

OUTPUT:
2652
5304
7956

--Sample Case 2--
INPUT:
4
9

OUTPUT:
36
72
108

Your source code for this problem should be in one file, and should be
named pairs.cpp (or whatever extension your language uses i.e. .java, .c, etc.)
The input will be entered through standard in. Not command line params.
