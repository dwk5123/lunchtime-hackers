								Team Standing

On one Sunday afternoon a Steelers fan and a Patriots fan got into a heated
debate of whose team would win should they ever play.  However, since the teams
never meet in the regular season, one of them had the bright idea to look at 
opponents the two teams had in common.  

They concluded that if teamA beat teamB, and teamB beat teamC, then teamA beat
teamC indirectly.  This sort of logic can get complicated quickly so that's 
where you come in.  Design a program that can determine the following cases:

(a) one team has defeated the other directly
(b) one team has defeated the other indirectly, meaning that it has defeated a 
	team that has defeated the other, or that it has defeated a team that has 
	defeated a team that has defeated the other, etc. 
(c) each team has defeated the other indirectly 
(d) neither team has defeated the other either directly nor indirectly.

There are no ties and no two teams play each other more than once.
